# 🧠 Software Engineering Interview Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a technical interview assignment covering data structures, algorithms, computer graphics, and systems-level thinking. Each problem is solved in C++ and explained thoroughly.

## 📌 Problem List

### a) String Compression & Decompression
- Basic run-length encoding
- Optimized compression by removing redundant "1"
- Decompression to restore the original

### b) 3D Solar System (OpenGL)
- Hierarchical modeling of Sun, Earth, and Moon
- OpenGL transformations and lighting

### c) Rainwater Trapping
- Discrete: array-based implementation
- Analog: function-based terrain sampling

### d) Fast Inverse Square Root
- Quake III inspired bit manipulation + Newton's method

### e) Rectangle Intersection
- Axis-aligned bounding box overlap check

### f) Round Robin Scheduler
- CPU scheduling simulation using queues

## 💻 How to Run

- Compile C++ files using:
  g++ filename.cpp -o program
  ./program

- OpenGL file (b_) requires GLUT installed.
